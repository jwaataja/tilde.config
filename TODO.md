# General
- When updating or uninstalling modules, do dependencies have to be taken into
    account? Currently, they are not.

# Documentation
- Document the command line options.
- Make sure `--directory-merge-strategy` is documented.
- Make sure `--ignore-errors` is documented.
- Document the `directory` command how it relates to the `file` and `file_glob`
  commands (currently, `directory` is an alias for file, add check to prevent
  this?).
